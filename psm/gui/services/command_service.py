"""Command execution service with standardized lifecycle.

This service encapsulates CLI command execution with a consistent lifecycle:
1. Pre-execution: disable actions, clear log, set progress
2. Execution: stream logs/progress via callbacks
3. Post-execution: enable actions, show result, refresh data

This follows the Single Responsibility Principle by extracting command
execution orchestration from controllers.
