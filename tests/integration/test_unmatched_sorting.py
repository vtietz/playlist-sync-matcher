"""Test unmatched diagnostics ordering using scoring engine.

We simulate playlist popularity and assert that the unmatched ordering logic
in the former engine is now approximated by ensuring all tracks remain
unmatched (no library files) and the service returns the expected count.

Note: Detailed ordering output was previously emitted via debug logs. The
new service collects unmatched list sorted by artist/album/title. Here we
retain the scenario to ensure no accidental matches and presence of all
unmatched IDs.
