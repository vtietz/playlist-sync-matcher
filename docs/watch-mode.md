# Watch Mode Guide

**Status:** Production-ready as of v1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025

---

## Overview

Watch mode enables automatic, real-time synchronization of your local music library database as files change on disk. Instead of manually running `scan` after adding or modifying music files, the tool monitors your library paths and updates the database automatically.

**Key Features:**
- üîÑ Automatic file detection (new, modified, deleted)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Intelligent debouncing to avoid event storms
- üöÄ Incremental updates (only changed files processed)
- üíæ Low resource usage (< 50 MB RAM, < 5% CPU when idle)
- üõ°Ô∏è Graceful handling of interruptions (Ctrl+C)
- üîß Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Watch Mode

Monitor your library and automatically update the database:

```bash
psm scan --watch
```

This will:
1. Start monitoring all configured library paths
2. Detect file changes (create, modify, delete)
3. Update the database after changes settle (2-second debounce)
4. Continue running until you press Ctrl+C

### Custom Debounce Time

Adjust the quiet period before processing changes:

```bash
# Wait 5 seconds after last change
psm scan --watch --debounce 5

# Immediate processing (1 second)
psm scan --watch --debounce 1
```

**When to adjust debounce:**
- **Increase** (5-10s): When frequently copying large batches of files
- **Decrease** (1s): When you want near-instant updates for single file changes

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Active Music Organization

You're tagging and organizing your music library:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for changes
psm scan --watch

# Terminal 2: Edit tags, move files, etc.
# Changes are automatically detected and processed
```

### 2. Continuous Download Monitoring

Automatically index new downloads:

```bash
# Point library path to your Downloads/Music folder
psm scan --watch --debounce 10
```

The longer debounce prevents processing while large downloads are in progress.

### 3. Network Drive Monitoring

For NFS/SMB mounts, watch mode may be unreliable. Use polling instead:

```bash
# Run periodic scans every 5 minutes
while true; do psm scan --quick; sleep 300; done
```

---

## How It Works

### Event Detection

Watch mode uses the `watchdog` library, which leverages OS-native filesystem APIs:

| OS | Technology | Performance |
|----|------------|-------------|
| **Windows** | `ReadDirectoryChangesW` | Excellent |
| **Linux** | `inotify` | Excellent |
| **macOS** | `FSEvents` | Excellent |

These APIs are event-driven (not polling), so CPU usage is minimal.

### Debouncing

When files change rapidly (e.g., copying an album), watch mode collects events and waits for a quiet period before processing:

```
File 1 added  ‚îÄ‚îê
File 2 added  ‚îÄ‚î§
File 3 added  ‚îÄ‚î§‚îÄ‚îÄ 2s debounce ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Process all 3 files together
File 4 added  ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents excessive database writes
- Batches related changes for efficiency
- Avoids processing temporary files

### Event Filtering

Not all filesystem events trigger database updates:

**Processed:**
- `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, etc. (configured extensions)
- File creation, modification, deletion, rename

**Ignored:**
- Temporary files (`.tmp`, `.part`, `.download`)
- Directories
- Non-music files
- Files matching `ignore_patterns` in config

---

## Incremental Scan Options

In addition to watch mode, there are other incremental scan modes:

### Time-Based Scanning

Scan only files modified after a specific time:

```bash
# Last 2 hours
psm scan --since "2 hours ago"

# Last 30 minutes
psm scan --since "30 minutes ago"

# Specific date/time
psm scan --since "2025-10-08 10:00:00"

# Unix timestamp
psm scan --since "1728123456.789"
```

**Use case:** Periodic cron job that scans recent changes.

### Quick Mode

Automatically detect what changed since last scan:

```bash
psm scan --quick
```

This reads `last_scan_time` from the database and scans only files modified since then.

**Use case:** Manual re-scan after batch operations.

### Specific Paths

Scan only certain directories:

```bash
# Single directory
psm scan --paths ./Music/NewAlbum/

# Multiple directories
psm scan --paths ./Music/Artist1/ ./Music/Artist2/
```

**Use case:** You just downloaded one album and want to index only that.

## Configuration

### Library Settings

In your `config.yml` or `config.json`:

```yaml
library:
  paths:
    - "Z:/Music/Artists"
    - "Z:/Music/Compilations"
  
  extensions:
    - ".mp3"
    - ".flac"
    - ".m4a"
    - ".ogg"
    - ".wav"
  
  ignore_patterns:
    - ".stfolder"  # Syncthing metadata
    - ".git"
    - "*.tmp"
  
  skip_unchanged: true
  fast_scan: true
```

**Key options for watch mode:**
- `extensions`: Only these file types trigger events
- `ignore_patterns`: Patterns to exclude from watching

### Watch-Specific Config

Currently, debounce time is set via CLI flag. Future versions may add:

```yaml
library:
  watch:
    debounce_seconds: 2.0
    max_batch_size: 1000
    enable_auto_match: false  # Auto-run match after scan
```

## Troubleshooting

### Watch Mode Not Detecting Changes

**Symptoms:** Files change, but database doesn't update.

**Possible causes:**

1. **Network drives (NFS/SMB):**
   - Filesystem events may not propagate properly
   - **Solution:** Use `--quick` mode with a cron job instead

2. **File extension not monitored:**
   - Check `library.extensions` in config
   - **Solution:** Add extension to config

3. **Ignore pattern blocking files:**
   - Check `library.ignore_patterns`
   - **Solution:** Remove or adjust pattern

4. **Path not in library config:**
   - Files must be under a configured `library.paths`
   - **Solution:** Add path to config

### High CPU Usage

**Symptoms:** Watch mode uses excessive CPU.

**Possible causes:**

1. **Event storm:**
   - Thousands of files changing simultaneously
   - **Solution:** Increase debounce time (`--debounce 10`)

2. **Recursive watching too deep:**
   - Very deep directory hierarchies (>20 levels)
   - **Solution:** Reorganize library or use `--quick` polling

3. **Antivirus interference:**
   - AV scanning new files triggers duplicate events
   - **Solution:** Exclude library paths from real-time scanning

### Watch Mode Crashes

**Symptoms:** Process exits unexpectedly.

**Possible causes:**

1. **OS file handle limits:**
   - Too many directories being watched (>10,000)
   - **Solution:** Split library into multiple watch sessions

2. **Database lock timeout:**
   - Another process holding DB lock
   - **Solution:** Ensure only one PSM instance accesses DB

3. **Memory exhaustion:**
   - Very large event queue (rare)
   - **Solution:** Restart with higher debounce

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

Typical resource usage for watch mode:

| Library Size | Memory | CPU (idle) | CPU (active) |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 1,000 files  | ~20 MB | <1%        | 5-10%        |
| 10,000 files | ~35 MB | 1-2%       | 10-15%       |
| 50,000 files | ~60 MB | 2-3%       | 15-25%       |

**"Active" = processing a batch of changes**

### Scaling Limits

Watch mode scales well up to:
- ‚úÖ **50,000 files** across hundreds of directories
- ‚úÖ **Batches of 1,000 simultaneous changes**
- ‚úÖ **Deep hierarchies** (20+ levels)

Beyond this, consider:
- Splitting library into multiple instances
- Using periodic `--quick` scans instead

### Network Drives

**Reliability:**
- ‚úÖ **Local drives** (SSD/HDD): Excellent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SMB/CIFS**: Unreliable (depends on OS/driver)
- ‚ùå **NFS**: Generally unreliable
- ‚ùå **Cloud sync** (Dropbox, OneDrive): Not recommended

**Alternative for network drives:**

```bash
# Cron job: every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/project && ./run.sh scan --quick
```

## Advanced Usage

### Running as a Service

#### Linux (systemd)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/psm-watch.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Playlist Sync Matcher Watch Mode
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/home/youruser/playlist-sync-matcher
ExecStart=/home/youruser/playlist-sync-matcher/run.sh scan --watch
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable psm-watch
sudo systemctl start psm-watch
sudo systemctl status psm-watch
```

#### Windows (Task Scheduler)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Task ‚Üí General:
   - Name: "PSM Watch Mode"
   - Run whether user is logged on or not
3. Triggers ‚Üí New:
   - Begin: At startup
4. Actions ‚Üí New:
   - Program: `C:\path\to\run.bat`
   - Arguments: `scan --watch`
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\project`
5. Conditions:
   - Uncheck "Start only if on AC power"

#### macOS (launchd)

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.psm.watch.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.psm.watch</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/path/to/run.sh</string>
        <string>scan</string>
        <string>--watch</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/path/to/project</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Load:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.psm.watch.plist
launchctl start com.psm.watch
```

### Combining with Other Commands

Watch mode updates the database, but doesn't automatically run matching or export:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for library changes
psm scan --watch

# Terminal 2: Manually trigger downstream steps when needed
psm match
psm export
psm report
```

**Future enhancement:** `psm build --watch` will orchestrate the full pipeline.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use `--watch` with `--since` or `--quick`?**  
A: No, `--watch` is a different mode and cannot be combined with other scan flags.

**Q: Does watch mode work on cloud-synced folders?**  
A: Generally no. Cloud sync tools (Dropbox, OneDrive) may not trigger filesystem events reliably. Use `--quick` mode with cron instead.

**Q: What happens if I modify a file while watch mode is processing?**  
A: The debounce timer resets, and the file will be processed again after the quiet period.

**Q: Can I run multiple watch instances?**  
A: Not recommended. Multiple instances may conflict when accessing the SQLite database. Use one watcher for all paths.

**Q: Does watch mode detect file renames?**  
A: Yes, renames are treated as delete + create events. The old path is removed and the new path is added.

**Q: What if my library has 100,000+ files?**  
A: Watch mode may struggle with very large libraries. Consider:
- Split into multiple smaller libraries
- Use periodic `--quick` scans instead
- Increase `--debounce` time
