# v0.1.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 1, 2025

## What's New

This release focuses on **developer experience, code quality, and infrastructure improvements**. No new end-user features, but significant enhancements to the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### CLI Command Registration
- **Fixed missing commands** - `analyze`, `diagnose`, `config`, and OAuth commands (`redirect-uri`, `token-info`) were not properly registered in the CLI
- **Fixed help text** - Corrected `match-diagnose` ‚Üí `diagnose` in help examples to match actual command name
- **Fixed tests** - Updated test assertions to check for correct command names

### üîß Developer & Infrastructure Improvements

#### Code Quality & Formatting
- **Black Formatting** - Applied consistent PEP 8 formatting across entire codebase (203 files)
- **Format Enforcement** - Added GitHub Actions workflow to enforce Black formatting on all PRs
- **Code Analysis Tools** - Enhanced `analyze_code.py` with link checking integration and UTF-8 support

#### Requirements Split (Smaller Executables!)
- **Created `requirements-dev.txt`** - Separated development tools from runtime dependencies
- **Reduced executable sizes** - Dev tools (pytest, black, flake8, lizard, autoflake) no longer bundled in executables
- **Updated PyInstaller specs** - Explicitly exclude dev/test tools from builds
- **Updated workflows** - CI uses `requirements-dev.txt`, releases use `requirements.txt` + pyinstaller only

#### CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements
- **macOS Testing** - Added macOS to test matrix for complete platform coverage (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- **Pre-release Detection** - Automatic handling of rc/beta/alpha release tags
- **Link Validation** - Integrated link checking into CI workflow
- **Code Quality Checks** - Automated complexity, style, and formatting checks
- **Better Caching** - Simplified pip caching with `cache: 'pip'` for faster builds
- **Step Summaries** - Enhanced GitHub Actions visibility with step summaries

#### Documentation
- **Streamlined README** - Reduced from 815 to 336 lines (59% smaller), removed redundancy
- **Fixed 174 broken links** - Comprehensive link validation and repair across all documentation
- **Removed outdated docs** - Deleted 3 obsolete files (ai-assessment.md, GUI DEVELOPMENT.MD, etc.)
- **New documentation** - Added `MISSING_DOCS.md` to track potentially useful docs, `REQUIREMENTS-SPLIT.md` explaining dependency separation

#### Development Tools
- **Link Checker** (`check_links.py`) - Validates all markdown links across 60 documentation files
- **Code Cleanup** (`cleanup_code.py`) - Automated Black formatting, whitespace cleanup, unused import removal
- **Enhanced Analyzer** (`analyze_code.py`) - Integrated link checking, UTF-8 Windows support

### üì¶ Build Improvements

**Smaller Executables:**
By excluding dev tools from PyInstaller builds, the executables are now smaller and faster to build. Dev dependencies are only installed during development and CI testing.

**Faster CI Builds:**
Simplified dependency installation and better caching reduce CI build times.

## Download Options

### Bundles (Recommended)
Each bundle contains **both** the GUI and the CLI:
- **Windows**: `playlist-sync-matcher-v0.1.2-Win64.zip` ‚Üí `psm-gui.exe` + `psm-cli.exe`
- **macOS**: `playlist-sync-matcher-v0.1.2-macOS-x64.tar.gz` ‚Üí `psm-gui` + `psm-cli`
- **Linux**: `playlist-sync-matcher-v0.1.2-Linux64.tar.gz` ‚Üí `psm-gui` + `psm-cli`

## Upgrade Notes

### From v0.1.1
No breaking changes or database migrations required. Simply replace your executables with the new versions.

**For developers:**
- Run `run.bat install` or `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install updated dependencies
- Black formatting is now enforced - run `run.bat cleanup changed` to format your code

## Technical Details

### Requirements Structure
- **`requirements.txt`** - Runtime dependencies only (bundled in executables)
- **`requirements-dev.txt`** - Development tools (pytest, black, flake8, etc.) + runtime deps

### PyInstaller Exclusions
Both CLI and GUI specs now explicitly exclude:
- pytest, black, flake8, lizard, autoflake
- pycodestyle, pyflakes, mccabe

### CI Workflow Changes
- **CI (testing)**: Uses `requirements-dev.txt`
- **Release (building)**: Uses `requirements.txt` + `pyinstaller==6.3.0`
